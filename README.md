# g_base_package

Base functionality for a project

## Getting Started

This project is a starting point for a Dart
[package](https://flutter.dev/developing-packages/),
a library module containing code that can be shared easily across
multiple Flutter or Dart projects.

For help getting started with Flutter, view our 
[online documentation](https://flutter.dev/docs), which offers tutorials, 
samples, guidance on mobile development, and a full API reference.

**Here is an example of how to load the package in your pubspec.yaml**
 

        dependencies:  
          flutter:  
            sdk: flutter 
             
          g_base_package:  
            git:  
              url: git://github.com/2math/g_base_package.git  
              ref: 0.0.1  
    #ref: 0.0.1 is pointing at TAG "0.0.1"          
    #don't forget to check for new version by tag at https://github.com/2math/g_base_package or in
